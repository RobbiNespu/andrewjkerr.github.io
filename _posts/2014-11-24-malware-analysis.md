Since I've been asked a lot about the Malware Reverse Engineering class offered during the spring by Dr. Wilson, I decided that it might be time to write a blog post about it and give some insight into what you'll be doing.

First, let's talk about pre-reqs. I'd say the biggest pre-req for this class is an actual interest in reverse engineering. It does get boring looking through what seems to be endless assembly code, but having an interest in learning about the inner workings of a piece of malware (or, I guess software in general) will definitely help you get through it. Another recommendation is knowing some form of assembly. What you learn with MIPS will probably be enough, but taking/having taken Microprocessors will be a big help. However, if you don't know assembly, it's fairly easy to pick up, but will be somewhat challenging. The only other pre-req I'd recommend for this class is knowledge of how a program uses memory in order to execute it's instructions. For example, knowledge of how the stack looks after a function call is definitely something you should have beforehand.

Now that the pre-reqs are out of the way, let's talk about the structure of the class - just know that this might have changed since I took it. There were short, in class quizzes at the start of _every_ class that required you to read the textbook (which is __very__ good if I might add) the night before. The quizzes were fairly easy if you read or had previous knowledge, but there were definitely some tricky questions. There are also malware practicals (which I'll get to in a second) every few weeks as well as a final exam.

The malware practicals were probably the best part of the course. In these practicals, we were given malware samples and had to provide an in depth analysis about it. This analysis included static analysis (things like dependencies, resources, packed/not packed, etc) and then also dynamic analysis (packet capture, modified registry keys, etc). In the interest of providing some sample reports, I'll link both the assignment and my analysis at the end of this post.

All in all, I really enjoyed this course and found the practicals to be, well, practical and a lot of fun. Even writing the reports weren't too bad (shocking!) and I think they turned out fairly well. If you have any questions about the course, tweet [@andrewuf](https://twitter.com/andrewuf) or shoot me [an email](mailto:me@andrewjkerr.com).
