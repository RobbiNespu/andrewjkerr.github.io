A few months ago, a good friend of mine introduced a new idea that I liked and wanted to contribute to: [live projects](http://liveprojects.thatdevlife.com/).

<br />

The premise of a live project is to, well, work on a project live. Personally, I'm a huge fan of the whole "mistakes are beautiful" concept that he puts forth. While watching a programmer debug an error for quite possibly a few hours doesn't sound too much fun, the knowledge gained from watching that programmer debug the error can be very valuable. While I (hopefully) won't be debugging errors for hours, I do want to record myself doing cool stuff in an attempt to teach my peers.

<br />


My modifications to the original live projects are as followed:

* Doesn't have to be code. Other topics, such as security, sometimes do not involve code, but still be relevant to a programmer.
* A retrospective will be posted. Structured more as a tl;dr, this is so that viewers do not have to spend hours watching me debug errors.
* More like a class/lecture. I want to be prepared, but also have that "element of surprise" factor that allows viewers to see an error occur. Assuming an error does occur, it's either planned or something that can be fixed easily.

<br />

Sound cool? Well, let's get into the topic that I will be presenting on: basic malware analysis.

<br />

I chose basic malware analysis as my introductory topic because, well, I took a class in that this semester and I found it to be pretty interesting and cool. Also, a lot of the tools used for analyzing malware are used to spot potential security holes in __YOUR__ software. Looking at a lot of write ups for security vulnerabilities found, IDA, OllyDbg, and others have been used to find and exploit those vulnerabilities in software and, knowing what tools are available and what they can do can help a programmer write secure software (or, at least attempt to write secure software.)

# Details
<br />

* __What__: A malware sample provided by my Malware Reverse Engineering professor that will be distributed at the beginning of the Live Project.
* __When__: The week of May 4 - May 10. Time TBD by group votes.
* __Why__: To gain an introductory understanding of basic static and dynamic analysis of an application (in this case, malware.)
* __Where__: The Interwebz. Most likely Google Hangouts.
* __How__: Ah, here's where things get interesting. To be able to participate in this Live Project, you will need the following:

	* A Windows VM (I'll be using XP) with the following software:
		* OllyDbg
		* IDA Free
		* PEView
		* Dependency Walker
		* Process Hacker
		* procmon
		* RegShot
		* Possibly more (might add onto this list later!)
	* A Linux VM (I'll be using REMnux) with the following software:
		* fakedns
		* inetsim
		* Wireshark
