## What a welcome indeed!
I've used jekyll a bit in the past, but I'm ready to give it another shot. Like I mentioned in the header, I'm not *quite* sure what I'm going to do with this GitHub site, but I decided to use it as a jekyll training ground as I've found that Markdown is quite cool and easy and want to see what jekyll can do. The docs seem quite nice, so let's see what I can cook up! :)
