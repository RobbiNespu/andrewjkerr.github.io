Since I've found myself making a few new Rails and Middleman projects recently I decided to go ahead and put some starter templates together!

Both my Rails and Middleman starters default to [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/), [Coffeescript](http://coffeescript.org/), and [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/). If you noticed, I really prefer languages that don't have a lot of extra "fluff" like parenthesis and curly brackets and these three languages get rid of _most_ of it. If you haven't checked them out, I highly recommend doing so. They save me a ton of time and, in my opinion, make my code a lot more readable.

I also (now) prefer things like [Bourbon](http://bourbon.io/), [Neat](http://neat.bourbon.io/), and [Bitters](http://bitters.bourbon.io/) to Bootstrap and they come packaged in a nice gem format. With Middleman, I've already installed Bitters and included all of the correct files so you'll be ready to jump in and start using them.

My RailsStarter uses [Puma](https://github.com/puma/puma) for the server and [Postgres](http://www.postgresql.org/) for the database as those are what I've been using for a few projects and have found them to be the best for my use cases.

If those defaults sound right up your alley, feel free to clone the repos for your next project:

- [https://github.com/andrewjkerr/rails_starter](https://github.com/andrewjkerr/rails_starter)
- [https://github.com/andrewjkerr/middleman_starter](https://github.com/andrewjkerr/middleman_starter)

You can also deploy the MiddlemanStarter to Heroku:

(As a side note, this site/blog is currently powered by Jekyll, but I will be switching over to Middleman soon enough!)
