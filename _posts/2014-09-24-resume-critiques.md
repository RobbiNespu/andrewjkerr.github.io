Over the years, I've had a lot of help with my [resume](http://andrewjkerr.github.io/resume.pdf) and I've always appreciated the people who took the time to look over it. They have always given me good feedback which have helped me up my resume game and have an awesome resume.

So, with Career Showcase coming up, I'd like to give back and do some critiques. If you want me to critique your resume, please send an email to [me AT andrewjkerr DOT com](mailto:me@andrewjkerr.com?Subject=Resume Critique) and I'll give you some feedback.

Two things to note though:

1. My feedback is just my opinion and I'm not a professional recruiter. However, I've learned what makes or breaks a resume over the years and am willing to share what I've learned.
2. If I get a lot of resumes, I _might_ not get around to yours. I'm going off of a first come, first served basis so send them in early :)

While I'm on the topic of resumes, there are a bunch of upcoming events that UF students (specifically CISE/ECE) should be aware of:

* [The Career Development Workshop](https://www.cise.ufl.edu/careerworkshop/index.shtml) - Sep 24, 2014 from 1800-2200 at [the Hilton University of Florida Conference Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Hilton+University+Of+Florida+Conference+Center+Gainesville/@29.636699,-82.37397,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0x65c4942b63b31ec0)
* [Career Showcase](http://www.crc.ufl.edu/employers/employerCareerShowcase.html) - Oct 01, 2014 from 0900-1500 in [the O'Connell Center](https://www.google.com/maps/place/o'connell+center/@29.64981,-82.35067,15z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x0:0xcdc7ad98656bfefd?sa=X&ei=oTkjVPiAMcz8oQTNi4KABg&ved=0CKIBEPwSMBI)
