Everyone has their favorite apps, but these are mine!

Since I've mostly 'perfected' my latest OSX setup, I figured now was a good time to show off what applications I use the most and explain why. Moving from left to right:


<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finder_(software)">Finder</a></h3>
Well, it's quite obvious why this is here. I need to access my file system somehow! I used to use Path Finder, but I mainly used it for the tabs which Finder has now.


<h3><a href="http://limechat.net/mac/">LimeChat</a></h3>
LimeChat is my IRC client of choice. While it still has a few bugs, I've found it much better than the competition for OSX in terms of ease of use and customizability.


<h3><a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/">Google Chrome</a></h3>
Since I'm a heavy Google user, it's an obvious choice when it comes to web browsers. I switched to Chrome back in 2011 when Firefox 4.0 came out and haven't looked back since. Also, the Chrome Developer Tools are super awesome for web design and I'm a huge fan of that over Firebug.


<h3><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a></h3>
I never used TextMate 1.0, but the 2.0 alpha is my favorite text editor out there. It has all of the features I need: syntax highlighting, file browser, tabs, awesome shortcuts, and free! (Being free is a feature right?)


<h3><a href="https://kbhomes.github.io/radiant-player-mac/">Radiant Player</a></h3>
Like I mentioned earlier, I'm a heavy Google user and that includes Google Music. However, I have a few issues with my music being played in a web browser. The biggest one is the lack of media shortcuts from the keyboard (and now <a href="http://www.razerzone.com/gaming-mice/razer-naga/">my mouse</a>) which the original version of Radiant Player (then just called Google Music for OSX) solved. Another one was the lack of Last.fm scrobbling and one of the updates of Radiant Player added that in! I seriously cannot recommend this enough if you use OSX and are a Google Music user. (Tip: try the Spotify Black theme. So good!)


<h3><a href="http://xbmc.org/">XBMC</a></h3>
First used on a Raspberry Pi media center I set up for my parents, XBMC is my media center software of choice. It's remote friendly interface makes it easy to lay back in bed and use <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Ortek-Windows-Infrared-Receiver-Ultimate/dp/B00224ZDFY">my remote</a> to control my media. 


<h3><a href="http://www.vmware.com/products/fusion/">VMWare Fusion</a></h3>
While VMWare Fusion is not free, I cannot recommend this enough if you need virtualization software! All of my sophomore year I used VirtualBox and had a lot of issues installing and using virtual machines, but VMWare Fusion makes it so damn easy to install new VMs as well as setting them up with all of the nice features VMWare Fusion offers.


<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_(OS_X)">Terminal</a></h3>
I work in the command line a lot, so Terminal on my dock is a must. Also another reason why OSX is much better than Windows (ugh, command prompt.)


<h3><a href="https://mac.github.com/">GitHub</a></h3>
Even though I can use git, I choose to use the GitHub app since it's a lot easier to do most things in.


<h3><a href="http://store.steampowered.com/">Steam</a></h3>
I rarely play video games, but I normally play them through Steam. Steam makes it easy to play with others as well as sync your games from computer to computer. I use it on my Windows partition and can jump from one game on Windows to another on OSX. It's great!


<h3><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/System_Preferences">System Preferences</a></h3>
Another obvious one! I keep it in the dock mostly out of habit though.

My dock has definitely had some changes over the years (I still remember having TextWrangler as my default text editor). but I think I've found the perfect apps for my workflow. If you haven't given one of these a shot, I highly recommend trying them. All of them are free (except for VMWare, but that's free for UF students with a CISE account!) so it doesn't hurt to download them and give them a try.
