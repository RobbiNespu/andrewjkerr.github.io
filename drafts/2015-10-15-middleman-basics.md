Earlier this year, I decided to switch this site from jekyll over to Middleman. I detailed some of the reasons over on [a blog post](http://andrewjkerr.com/blog/middleman/) and said that I made a [middleman_starter](https://github.com/andrewjkerr/middleman_starter) repository available, but never explained how to use it. Sure, the README outlines _how_ to set it up, but that's very very barebones and doesn't encapsulate the whole process of setting up and deploying a personalized Middleman site.
