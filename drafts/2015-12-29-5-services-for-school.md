As I enter my last semester at the University of Florida, I find that it's my duty to share some of my wisdom of things that have helped me through the last four and a half years. This week, I'm going to cover some of the essential services that I've used and how I've used them in order to make my life a lot easier.

### Computer Backups - Dropbox (Free)

I can't tell you how many times I've heard that someone's computer has broken and they have to start all over again.

Having my computer break down on me and losing all of my hard work is one of my worst fears.


1. Dropbox (for backup)
2. Google Drive (for group work)
3. Inbox by Google (for email)
4. 1Password (for security) (LastPass free alternative)
5. GitHub + GitHub Pages (for professionalism)
