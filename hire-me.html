		<h1>Hire Me</h1>
		<p>Lacking a website? Need someone to create internal tools? Want some advice about the technologies available to your company? I can help.</p>
		<p>I am currently available for <b>freelance work</b>. If you believe I am a good fit for your project, drop me a line at <a href="mailto:me@andrewjkerr.com">me AT andrewjkerr DOT com</a> and let's discuss.</p>

		<h2 id="web">Web Development</h2>
		<p>Ever since I was in middle school, I've been living and breathing web. I made my first website when I was in seventh grade, bought my first domain name in eigth grade, and created my first dynamic website in ninth grade.</p>
		<p>My typical tech stack has definitely changed since back then, but I am confident in my ability to create a beautiful, intuitive, and functional web site using HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, and PHP. I will also be more than happy to manage your domain, email system, and hosting as well.</p>
		
		<h2 id="dev">Application Development</h2>
		<p>If you find you or your employees doing repetitive tasks over and over again there's a big chance that automation can help with that. I've written several Ruby scripts to make my life easier and I can do the same for you or your company.</p>
		
		<h2 id="consulting">Consulting</h2>
		<p>There are a ton of technologies available now and figuring out which one to use can be very difficult. If you or your company is looking to make a change to the infrastructure, but wants a second opinion, I'd be more than willing to sit down and discuss the changes with you.</p>
