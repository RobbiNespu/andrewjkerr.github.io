  Just a nerd who likes music, funny things, and computers. Currently an __intern at [BlockScore](https://blockscore.com)__ in Mountain View. Future __security intern at [Tumblr](https://tumblr.com)__ in New York City. Normally __Software Engineering student at the [University of Florida](https://ufl.edu)__.

  I'm interested in [Ruby on Rails](https://github.com/andrewjkerr/rails_starter), web app security, clean design, and a good cup of coffee.
