The new year brings some new challenges, adventures, and, as always, courses.

This year I plan on learning a ton. Over the break, I discovered my passion for web development and that I want to persue opportunities in improving my web development skills (with an emphasis on __development__ and not design, obviously.) To do this, I'm going to start learning Rails this month and continue using Rails throughout this semester in hopes that I can build my Databases project with Rails as well as convert a now discontinued project from PHP to Rails. My current goal for this is __end of February.__

One of the next things I want to dive into is Android Development. I've had a book from Big Nerd Ranch for awhile now, but I haven't really cracked it open yet. Why Android? Well, I've got an interest in Android from all of the years of rooting and modding as well as a love for Java so I figured why not? I haven't come up with a project yet, but hopefully I'll have a decent understanding by the __end of April.__

Other than that, I don't really have any other plans other than to advance my PHP/MySQL/Javascript/jQuery knowledge from time to time as well as passing my classes.

Speaking of classes, here's a list of what I'm taking this semester:

* Malware Reverse Engineering - Exactly what it sounds like. I'm pretty excited for this course and am hoping to learn a lot. The textbook (Practical Malware Analysis) seems to actually be good and quite interesting.
* Digital Design - Hardware design with VHDL. VHDL seems like quite a broken language so far, but it's supposedly more programming than hardware which I am always a fan of.
* Databases - I'm not sure what to think of this class yet. We've covered a history of databases so far, but I've heard that we don't actually write any SQL until more than halfway through the class. The professor comes highly recommended from one of my other professors (who is actually his sponsor) and we're using PostgreSQL which I'm not familiar with so hopefully I learn a lot.
* Intro to Electrical Engineering and Computer Engineering - My ethics requirement. I wish Ethical Hacking & Penetration Testing would have counted for this...

Well, that's my plan for this semester. As for summer plans, we'll have to see where I end up at and what I end up doing! :)
