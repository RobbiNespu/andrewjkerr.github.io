It's been awhile since I've written here, but I've got a few side blogs that I should mention (and, you can follow!).

## [Andrew's Reading List](http://books.andrewjkerr.com)

A few months ago, I decided to start a Tumblelog that chronicles all of the books that I read (or, listen to). I don't get to read as much as I want to, but having a public log of books that I finish is a good motivator to read more. You can follow that at: [books.andrewjkerr.com](http://books.andrewjkerr.com).

## [Andrew's Recommendations](http://andrewrecommends.tumblr.com/)

This blog is about things that I use a lot and would recommend (hardware and, perhaps, software). There's only my mouse and keyboard, but feel free to follow for more content soon: [andrewrecommends.tumblr.com](http://andrewrecommends.tumblr.com/).

## [Art @ HQ](http://artathq.tumblr.com/)

I started this blog when I was still an intern at Tumblr and, now that I'm no longer there, cannot update it. Hopefully, someone else from Tumblr will realize this (\*cough\*) and take it over. Still, feel free to follow it: [artathq.tumblr.com](http://artathq.tumblr.com).
