Earlier tonight, I gave a presentation on cross-site scripting (XSS) and also created a handful of challenges to go along with them. As someone who primarily develops web applications, I was excited to be able to teach a security topic that was as close to my heart as XSS. I put quite a lot of work into this and will hopefully be able to improve upon these as the years go on and I give the talk again and again.

### Slides

The slides are located at [https://github.com/andrewjkerr/xss-presentation](https://github.com/andrewjkerr/xss-presentation). They were written using the fantastic [Deckset](decksetapp.com) OSX application and I plan on writing all of the presentations I can in markdown.

### Challenges

I wrote 7 challenges to accompany the presentation and the source can be found at [https://github.com/andrewjkerr/xss-challenges](https://github.com/andrewjkerr/xss-challenges). I'm only keeping the challenge server online for a few days, but I hope to add a Dockerfile in order to easily spin up the challenges!
