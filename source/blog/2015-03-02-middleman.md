As I mentioned about two weeks ago, I decided to start using [Middleman](https://middlemanapp.com/) instead of [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). I've used Jekyll for years, but finally decided to flip the switch today.

The primary reason for switching to Middleman was the ability to use [Slim](http://slim-lang.com/) to write content. As I [mentioned before](http://andrewjkerr.com/blog/starters/), Slim reduces the syntax to the point where your code is actually readable. I prefer languages that require less syntax (Ruby being one of them) so I absolutely love Slim.

You can find the source for this site in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/andrewjkerr/andrewjkerr.github.io) (on the source branch). If you're looking for something similar, feel free to fork either that repository or my [middleman_starter](https://github.com/andrewjkerr/middleman_starter) repo.
